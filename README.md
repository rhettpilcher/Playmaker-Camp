# Playmaker-Camp
This is a basic 2D platformer template I made with Unity and Playmaker for the Playmaker Summer Camp that I hosted at the Code Ninjas Franchise. Students would download this template and I help them set up controls, level building, power ups, and even let them design their own unique mechanics.
